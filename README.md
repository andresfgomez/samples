# samples

In this repository I add some projects where I apply different technologies, either to test new versions, to share with others or to present my code style to some recruiter.
By the way, it is not feasible to publish source code implemented in my job given some legal issues, so I try to publish some code demo.

<b>geo.world</b>
It is a java standalone application to query data about countries and cities.
The technology stack is JavaSE 8, Maven, Spring Framework 4.2.1, Jersey 2 (JAX-RS), Logback.

To see more detail information about the project, please see the readme included in every project sample.
